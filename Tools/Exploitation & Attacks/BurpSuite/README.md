## ❓ What is Burp Suite?

**Burp Suite** is a **web security testing framework** by **PortSwigger**, used to **intercept, analyze, and manipulate** HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

💡 **Think of Burp as a “smart middleman” between your browser and the server.**

### 🔑 Use Cases:

* Detect **SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and CSRF** vulnerabilities
* Test **authentication, session management, and cookies**
* Automate **fuzzing and brute force attacks**
* Perform **API security testing**

---

## 💻 Installation & Setup

### 🔹 1. Download Burp Suite

* Official site: [portswigger.net/burp](https://portswigger.net/burp)
* Versions:

  * **Community (Free)** → Great for learning
  * **Professional (Paid)** → Includes automated scanning & advanced features

### 🔹 2. Install Java (if required)

* Burp comes **bundled with Java**, but if missing, install **JRE 11+**

### 🔹 3. Configure Your Browser

1. Open Burp → `Proxy` tab → Ensure **Listener: 127.0.0.1:8080**
2. Set your browser’s proxy to:

   * **Host:** 127.0.0.1
   * **Port:** 8080
3. Import Burp’s **CA certificate** to intercept HTTPS traffic

✅ Tip: Use **Firefox** or a dedicated browser profile for security.

## 🖥️ Burp Suite Interface Overview

Burp Suite is divided into **intuitive tabs** for every task:

| Tab           | Purpose                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dashboard** | Overview of sessions, scan results, and history  |
| **Target**    | Define scope, organize site maps, view endpoints |
| **Proxy**     | Intercept, view, and modify requests/responses   |
| **Intruder**  | Automate attacks with payloads                   |
| **Repeater**  | Modify and resend requests manually              |
| **Sequencer** | Analyze randomness of session tokens             |
| **Decoder**   | Encode/Decode (Base64, URL, Hex, HTML)           |
| **Comparer**  | Compare requests/responses to spot differences   |
| **Extender**  | Install extensions from **BApp Store**           |

💡 **Visual Tip:** Think **Proxy → Repeater → Intruder → Scanner** as your main pentesting flow.

---

## ⭐ Key Features & Advantages

* **Intercept Traffic** → Inspect and modify requests in real-time
* **Define Scope** → Only test what matters
* **Manual + Automated Testing** → Flexibility for beginners & pros
* **Scanner (Pro)** → Automatic vulnerability detection
* **Plugin Support** → Extend with BApp Store extensions

---

## 🛠️ Core Tools Explained

### 🔹 Proxy

* Captures browser-server traffic
* Allows **editing requests before forwarding**
* Example: Modify **cookies, headers, or parameters**

### 🔹 Repeater

* Send **custom requests repeatedly**
* Test **parameter manipulation**
* Example: Change `id=1` → `id=2` and observe server response

### 🔹 Intruder

* Automates attacks with **payloads** (usernames, passwords, fuzz strings)
* Attack types:

  * **Sniper** → One variable at a time
  * **Battering Ram** → Same payload everywhere
  * **Pitchfork** → Parallel payloads
  * **Cluster Bomb** → All payload combinations

### 🔹 Scanner (Pro only)

* Finds vulnerabilities automatically, saves **manual effort**

### 🔹 Sequencer

* Tests randomness of session tokens for predictability

### 🔹 Decoder

* Convert between **Base64, Hex, URL encoding**, and more

### 🔹 Comparer

* Quickly spot differences between requests/responses

## ⌨️ Important Commands & Shortcuts

| Action                | Shortcut         |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Forward request       | Ctrl + F         |
| Intercept On/Off      | Ctrl + T         |
| Send to Repeater      | Ctrl + R         |
| Send to Intruder      | Ctrl + I         |
| Send to Decoder       | Ctrl + U         |
| Send to Comparer      | Ctrl + Shift + C |
| Clear intercept queue | Ctrl + Shift + Q |

💡 Memorize these for **faster workflow**.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration & Settings

* **Proxy Listener:** Default `127.0.0.1:8080`
* **SSL Certificates:** Install CA cert in browser
* **Scope:** Limit to your target domains
* **Logging:** Enable full request/response history
