# 🛠️ Tools

This section contains my notes and usage examples for the **essential tools** I use in penetration testing.  
Instead of googling commands every time, I collect them here for quick reference.

## Tools Covered:
- **Nmap** → Network scanning and enumeration  
- **Burp Suite** → Web application testing  
- **Hydra** → Brute force attacks  
- **John the Ripper** → Password cracking  
- **SQLmap** → SQL injection automation  
- **Metasploit** → Exploitation framework  
- **Wireshark** → Network traffic analysis  

📌 Each tool has its own folder with:
- `README.md` → Commands, use-cases, cheatsheets
