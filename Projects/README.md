# 📚 Offensive Security Projects

This folder contains my **hands-on projects** that demonstrate practical penetration testing skills.  
Each project follows a structured format: **Objective → Setup → Methodology → Findings → Report**.

## 🔐 Projects
- [Web Application Pentest](./WebAppPentestProject/)
- [Home Lab Setup](./HomeLab/)
- [Active Directory Lab](./ActiveDirectoryLab/)
- [VulnHub Pentest Reports](./VulnHubPentestReports/)

📝 Each project is documented like a real pentest report to showcase both **technical** and **professional reporting** skills.
